Chinese chess man-machine game system design and implementation.
Machine game is an important content and direction of research in the field of artificial intelligence, the system is mainly man-machine chess Chinese chess research, including the development of man-machine interface and search engine parts, the system is developed using Visual C + +6.0 environment, MFC Application framework. Article highlights some of the key technology research chess game, and gives the overall design and overall realization of Chinese chess game, has a good interactive interface and excellent search engine. Said the board did not use the elements of the traditional two-dimensional array, but the use of more efficient one-dimensional array, many operations can be obtained by shifting; situation assessment is the use of sophisticated sub-force value methodology; search algorithm is drawing on international chess in the mature experience, the use of Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm, on this basis by studying large number of documents, the use of replacement table, hash tables, Zobrist key, history and other techniques inspired search algorithm has been improved, playing strength has been significantly improved. Finally, the MFC framework program gives concrete realization of Chinese chess game.
